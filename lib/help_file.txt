// to change app icon

flutter pub upgrade --major-versions

flutter pub pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main 

flutter build appBundle --release

 --------     flutter NEW_VERSION_PLUS detects VERSION NUMBER and PLAYSTORE detects BUILD NUMBER changes


        ----- in case the version is not matching and causing unnecessary errors:

                    create a backup and then delete android folder and "flutter create ."

        ----- if you try to copy the files to a new project :

                    change the package name to the previous one 

                    copy required files like "googleservice", "firebase" related, and so on into that android 

                    update manifest for permissions and api keys (if any)

                    update build.gradle in "andoid" and "android/app" to import proper dependencies


for build appbundle for updated versions :

        keep the keystore from previous build with password and update in key.properties under android folder

        then update all the versions (that is after + symbol is must to update the value)
